# Bad-Apple-CSharp
This is my attempt at making the touhou music video Bad Aple in the C# console

For now I think it's ok, but I want to change to a higher rip of the ascii art, I have all the frames as PNG, so my next goal will be converting that too ASCII art and setting it up in a similar manner as the current ascii rip.

Also thanks to Chion82 and his project with doing this in Python, I made good use of his data, to set it up C#, though I didn't look at how he coded his, instead I just did mine out of what I thought would work.
